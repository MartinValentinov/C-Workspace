The function called compareasc takes two void constant pointers to constants and returns an int value. 
The function converts pointers to pointers of type int and compares the values ​​they point to. 
If the first value is greater than the second, the function returns 1. If the first value is less than the second, 
the function returns -1. If they are equal, the function returns 0. The second comparedesc function has the same 
structure as the first, except that it returns 1 if the first value is less than the second and -1 
if the first value is greater than the second (0 if both values ​​are equal).
