A function called bubblesort has been made. The function takes an array to sort,
 the number of elements in the array, a pointer to a function that specifies the
order in which to sort the array, and a pointer to a function that specifies 
how to swap two array elements. The swapelements pointer must point to a function that 
takes two void pointers and returns void. If the swap happens when the first element is 
greater than the second, then we have an ascending sort. If the swap happens when the first 
element is less than the second, then we have a descending sort.
