The idea is to make a header file "person.h" that declares a structure "Person" that contains information about the person's name, middle name and surname.
Тhe header file “schoolclass.h” inserts the header file “person.h” and declare a structure “SchoolClass” to contain an array of 26 students, the class class, the class number and the class teacher.
The header file “schoolroom.h” inserts the header file “person.h” in which a “SchoolRoom” struct is declared to contain the room number and information about which people are currently in that room. 
In the file, school.c, the header files “schoolclass.h” and “schoolroom.h” are inserted and a structure “School” is made containing school classes and school rooms. 
In the school.c file, a variable of type school is declared in main.
