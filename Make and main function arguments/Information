A program that will print a help menu on the screen that will give information about how to work with the application that you will implement with this homework. When the program is started, the names of three functions "strlength, strconcat and strcompare" should be displayed on the screen, and against each of them information about what it does. The first function strlength should find the length of a character string. The second strconcat function should concatenate two character strings. The third function strcompare should compare two character strings. The Makefile consists of two targets: “help.out”, which builds the application, and the “clean” target, which cleans up the files obtained during the compilation of the application. Header file “mystrings.h”, declares 3 functions to work with character strings. The first function (strlength) should find the length of a character string, the second (strconcat) should merge two character strings into the first passed as an argument to the function, the third function (strcompare) should lexically compare two character strings (return -1 if the first string is found lexically before the second, 0 - if the two character strings are the same and 1 if the first character string is found after the second). Example of strlength: Input: “Ivan” => Output: 4. Example of strconcat: Input: str1=Hello, str2=World => strconcat(str1, str2) => Output: str1=HelloWorld, str2=World. Example of strcompare: Input: “Alex”, “Alan” => Output: 1, input: “Alex”, “Alex” => Output: 0, input “Alex”, “Boyan” => Output: -1. Source file mystrings.c, inserts header file “mystrings.h” and defines functions (implements them). The three source files “strlength.c”, “strconcat.c”, “strcompare.c” demonstrate the operation of the three functions of the second task. The three programs take terminal arguments to run and must be compiled to executables: strlength.c -> strlength.out (strlength.exe on Windows), strconcat.c -> strconcat.out (strconcat.exe on Windows), and strcompare.c -> strcompare.out(strcompare.exe on Windows). Examples of the operation of the three programs executed through the terminal are: ./strlength.out Ivan => 4; ./strconcat.out Hello World => HelloWorld, ./strcompare Alex Boyan =>-1. All three programs must use the mystrings.o module to work. Since the strconcat.out program must concatenate two character strings into the first one, assume that the size of each of the two character strings (being concatenated) must not be more than 50 characters.
