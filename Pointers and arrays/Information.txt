1. The function finds the length of a character 
	string using address arithmetic to traverse the array.

2. The function sorts an array using address arithmetic. 
	A function called swap swaps two variables.

3. The function called strhalf accepts a character string and 
	a double pointer (pointer to pointer) of type char. The function 
	sets the pointer pointed to by the second argument to the middle 
	of the character string. A character string and a char pointer are 
	created and the function is called using these arguments. After 
	calling the strhalf function, the changed pointer is printed using 
	printf(“%s”) - it prints only the second half of the original character string.

4. The function takes a two-dimensional integer array that can have 
	any number of rows but has four columns and prints it as a table 
	using addressable arithmetic. The function also accepts the number of rows.
